This tutorial is using Flutter 3.0.5 Stateless Widgets vs Stateful Widgets Stateless Widgets the state of the widget cannot change over time Stateful Widgets the state of the widget can change over time What is State in Flutter? State can be described as "whatever data you need in order to rebuild your UI at any moment in time". When the state of your app changes (for example, the user flips a switch in the settings screen), you change the state, and that triggers a redraw of the user interface. There is no imperative changing of the UI itself (like widget.setText)— you change the state, and the UI rebuilds from scratch. Hot reload Flutter’s hot reload feature helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs. To hot reload a Flutter app: 1. Run the app from a supported Flutter editor or a terminal window. Either a physical or virtual device can be the target. Only Flutter apps in debug mode can be hot reloaded. 2. Modify one of the Dart files in your project. Most types of code changes can be hot reloaded; for a list of changes that require a hot restart, see Special cases. 3. If you’re working in an IDE/editor that supports Flutter’s IDE tools, select Save All (cmd-s/ctrl-s), or click the hot reload button on the toolbar. If you’re running the app at the command line using flutter run, enter r in the terminal window. After a successful hot reload operation, you’ll see a message in the console similar to: Performing hot reload... Reloaded 1 of 448 libraries in 978ms.
