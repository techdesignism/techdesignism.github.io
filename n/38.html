What is Flutter? Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In short, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android). Why you should learn Flutter? Simple to learn and use Flutter is a modern framework, you can get a feel for it! It's much simpler to create mobile apps with it. If you've used Java, Swift, or React Native, you'll notice the difference with Flutter. What I love about Flutter is that you can create truly native apps without a lot of code. Quick compilation: maximum productivity Thanks to Flutter, you can change your code and see the results in real-time. It’s called Hot-Reload. It only takes a short amount of time after you save to update the application itself. Significant modifications force you to reload the app. But if you do work like design, for example, and change the size of an element, it’s in real-time! Pros and Cons of Flutter Pros Flutter offers a wide range of benefits for business folks and developers alike. Flutter offers good quality for reasonable costs, as well as great usability and speed. - Development goes faster when the same code is used for both iOS and Android applications. Flutter’s singular codebase speeds up time-to-market while cutting mobile app development costs significantly. - Flutter app performance is equivalent to that of native real-time applications. Unlike other frameworks, Flutter apps do not need a bridge to interact with native components. Since these bridges typically cause performance issues, this gives Flutter a decided advantage. - Flutter’s “hot reload” feature allows developers to change the code on emulators, simulators, or real devices, and see results in real-time. The changed code is then reloaded immediately while the app is running. No restart required. Hot reloads make building UIs, adding features, and bug fixing simpler than ever. Cons While Flutter app development presents a lot of positives, it is also important to consider the lesser aspects of the framework: - Flutter is relatively new. While Flutter offers many plugins and UI components, frameworks like Xamarin and React Native offer a much larger selection. While Flutter will not be the new framework on the block forever, this is the situation now. - Dart is not very popular. While it is a great programming language, developers are often much more likely to consider languages such as Java or Kotlin. - Some components are only available for iOS or Android, but not both. These types of components more often support Android since Flutter comes from Google, and Android developers are typically more interested in Flutter than iOS developers.
