Every enterprise, whether small or large, has been adopting Docker for better productivity. Docker is not a very old concept in the market but is gaining momentum faster than any other technology. Docker offers several advantages when it is integrated with containerised and cloud architecture. The containerisation platform not only helps in the software development process but also in the deployment. You can create, test, and deploy large applications using Docker. It helps in team collaboration and saves significant time and effort. What is Docker? Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers—standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. Containers simplify the development and delivery of distributed applications. They have become increasingly popular as organizations shift to cloud-native development and hybrid multi-cloud environments. It’s possible for developers to create containers without Docker, by working directly with capabilities built into Linux and other operating systems. But Docker makes containerization faster, easier and safer. At this writing, Docker reported over 13 million developers using the platform. Docker vs VM - Lighter weight: Unlike Virtual Machines(VMs), containers don’t carry the payload of an entire OS instance and hypervisor. They include only the OS processes and dependencies necessary to execute the code. Container sizes are measured in megabytes (vs. gigabytes for some VMs), make better use of hardware capacity, and have faster startup times. - Improved developer productivity: Containerized applications can be written once and run anywhere. And compared to VMs, containers are faster and easier to deploy, provision and restart. This makes them ideal for use in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and a better fit for development teams adopting Agile and DevOps practices. - Greater resource efficiency: With containers, developers can run several times as many copies of an application on the same hardware as they can using VMs. This can reduce cloud spending. Best OS for Docker - Alpine You can use Alpine Linux as the underlying OS for many official Docker images. It is small in size and is different from the full-fat Linux distributions, which compete with Solaris. This OS runs on embedded systems, requiring minimal resources, making it perfect for Docker containers. Alpine Linux is mainly designed for and used by programmers. Alpine’s system libraries are well-suited for small, fast, and secure deployments. Super Lightweight .iso file size only around 150MB (alpine-standard-3.16.1-x86_64) Disk space usage only around 600MB after installation of os & docker Download Alpine: [https://www.alpinelinux.org/downloads/](https://www.alpinelinux.org/downloads/ "new tab") Download alpine-standard-3.16.1-x86_64.iso: [https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.16/releases/x86_64/alpine-standard-3.16.1-x86_64.iso](https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.16/releases/x86_64/alpine-standard-3.16.1-x86_64.iso "new tab") How to install Docker on Alpine Run this command: apk update && apk add docker docker-compose openrc && rc-update add docker boot && service docker start
