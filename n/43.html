This tutorial is using Flutter 3.0.5 What is widgets in Flutter? Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled iOS and Android apps from a single code base. To build any application we start with widgets â€“ The building block of flutter applications. Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state. It includes a text widget, row widget, column widget, container widget, and many more. Widgets: Each element on a screen of the Flutter app is a widget. The view of the screen completely depends upon the choice and sequence of the widgets used to build the app. And the structure of the code of an app is a tree of widgets. What is State in Flutter? State can be described as "whatever data you need in order to rebuild your UI at any moment in time". When the state of your app changes (for example, the user flips a switch in the settings screen), you change the state, and that triggers a redraw of the user interface. There is no imperative changing of the UI itself (like widget.setText)â€” you change the state, and the UI rebuilds from scratch. Study the initial demo project Open the project created on day 2. Day 2: [https://techdesignism.com/?n=40](https://techdesignism.com/?n=40 "new tab") The initial demo project in Flutter 3.0.5 would be like that: import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; void main() { runApp(const MyApp()); } class MyApp extends StatelessWidget { const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key); // This widget is the root of your application. @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MaterialApp( title: 'Flutter Demo', theme: ThemeData( // This is the theme of your application. // // Try running your application with "flutter run". You'll see the // application has a blue toolbar. Then, without quitting the app, try // changing the primarySwatch below to Colors.green and then invoke // "hot reload" (press "r" in the console where you ran "flutter run", // or simply save your changes to "hot reload" in a Flutter IDE). // Notice that the counter didn't reset back to zero; the application // is not restarted. primarySwatch: Colors.blue, ), home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'), ); } } class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget { const MyHomePage({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key); // This widget is the home page of your application. It is stateful, meaning // that it has a State object (defined below) that contains fields that affect // how it looks. // This class is the configuration for the state. It holds the values (in this // case the title) provided by the parent (in this case the App widget) and // used by the build method of the State. Fields in a Widget subclass are // always marked "final". final String title; @override State&lt;MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState(); } class _MyHomePageState extends State&lt;MyHomePage> { int _counter = 0; void _incrementCounter() { setState(() { // This call to setState tells the Flutter framework that something has // changed in this State, which causes it to rerun the build method below // so that the display can reflect the updated values. If we changed // _counter without calling setState(), then the build method would not be // called again, and so nothing would appear to happen. _counter++; }); } @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { // This method is rerun every time setState is called, for instance as done // by the _incrementCounter method above. // // The Flutter framework has been optimized to make rerunning build methods // fast, so that you can just rebuild anything that needs updating rather // than having to individually change instances of widgets. return Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( // Here we take the value from the MyHomePage object that was created by // the App.build method, and use it to set our appbar title. title: Text(widget.title), ), body: Center( // Center is a layout widget. It takes a single child and positions it // in the middle of the parent. child: Column( // Column is also a layout widget. It takes a list of children and // arranges them vertically. By default, it sizes itself to fit its // children horizontally, and tries to be as tall as its parent. // // Invoke "debug painting" (press "p" in the console, choose the // "Toggle Debug Paint" action from the Flutter Inspector in Android // Studio, or the "Toggle Debug Paint" command in Visual Studio Code) // to see the wireframe for each widget. // // Column has various properties to control how it sizes itself and // how it positions its children. Here we use mainAxisAlignment to // center the children vertically; the main axis here is the vertical // axis because Columns are vertical (the cross axis would be // horizontal). mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, children: &lt;Widget>[ const Text( 'You have pushed the button this many times:', ), Text( '$_counter', style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4, ), ], ), ), floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton( onPressed: _incrementCounter, tooltip: 'Increment', child: const Icon(Icons.add), ), // This trailing comma makes auto-formatting nicer for build methods. ); } } Structure of the demo app MyApp MaterialApp MyHomePage _MyHomePageState Scaffold AppBar Center Column Text Text FloatingActionButton ðŸ”¹ Scaffold â€“ Implements the basic material design visual layout structure. ðŸ”¹ AppBar â€“ To create a bar at the top of the screen. ðŸ”¹ Center â€“ To provide center alignment to other widgets. ðŸ”¹ Column â€“ A widget that displays its children in a vertical array. ðŸ”¹ Text â€“ To write anything on the screen. ðŸ”¹ FloatingActionButton â€“ A circular icon button that hovers over content to promote a primary action. _counter At the start of _MyHomePageState, we can see the initialization of the variable _counter. And _incrementCounter() is defined for increasing the _counter value. setState tells the Flutter framework that something has changed, which causes it to build the UI again. int _counter = 0; void _incrementCounter() { setState(() { // This call to setState tells the Flutter framework that something has // changed in this State, which causes it to rerun the build method below // so that the display can reflect the updated values. If we changed // _counter without calling setState(), then the build method would not be // called again, and so nothing would appear to happen. _counter++; }); } build(BuildContext context) This method is rerun every time setState is called to build the UI. @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { // This method is rerun every time setState is called, for instance as done // by the _incrementCounter method above. // // The Flutter framework has been optimized to make rerunning build methods // fast, so that you can just rebuild anything that needs updating rather // than having to individually change instances of widgets. return Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( // Here we take the value from the MyHomePage object that was created by // the App.build method, and use it to set our appbar title. title: Text(widget.title), ), body: Center( // Center is a layout widget. It takes a single child and positions it // in the middle of the parent. child: Column( // Column is also a layout widget. It takes a list of children and // arranges them vertically. By default, it sizes itself to fit its // children horizontally, and tries to be as tall as its parent. // // Invoke "debug painting" (press "p" in the console, choose the // "Toggle Debug Paint" action from the Flutter Inspector in Android // Studio, or the "Toggle Debug Paint" command in Visual Studio Code) // to see the wireframe for each widget. // // Column has various properties to control how it sizes itself and // how it positions its children.

Text( '$_counter', style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4, ) FloatingActionButton onPressed defined the action when you press the FloatingActionButton. In this case, _incrementCounter is called when you press the FloatingActionButton. floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton( onPressed: _incrementCounter, tooltip: 'Increment', child: const Icon(Icons.add), )
